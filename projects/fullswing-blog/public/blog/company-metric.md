During my 20+ years of being a software developer, I've encountered only one company that was doing most things right. This made the company very successful but also lended itself to my own success. I was promoted twice in 4 years and my salary reflected that. It felt like I had more growth in that 4 years than the other 16 years of my career combined.

I'm at a stage now, where if I find a new job, it must be similar to that company. I cannot afford to work full-time hours and study 10+ hours a week to stay current because I'm not learning at my position. Most companies grind you so hard you don't have time to tackle technical debt, 100% of deadlines are missed (superimposed unrealistic deadlines are often a tactic used by management), and you don't have time to refactor your code. I've even been in positions where I was hired as a senior and forced to work at a junior level. I often find myself asking: why are you even interviewing for advanced developer skills if you don't give them time or space to use them e.g. TDD, Agile, etc.

This leads to an important metric I wanted to come up with to evaluate companies during the interview process to determine if they are a company of higher caliber: (NOTE that this is a work in progress and I welcome feedback)

- More to come...

In the future, I want to refine the "The Joel Test" and add my opionated changes. I'll call it "The Jebb Test" and put it on my fridge.
