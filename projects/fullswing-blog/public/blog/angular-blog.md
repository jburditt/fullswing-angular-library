## How to create a simple Angular blog

Today, I set out to setup a very basic Angular blog with minimal features. As per usual, I packed in more than I planned because I love shiny new features; even when I can recognize that it is on the cusp of just adding clutter.

The below steps will help you setup your own Angular blog with the following optional features:
- Static Site Generation
- Zoneless
- Markdown

1. Create a new a new Angular application. At the time of writing, I installed version 20.2. I suggest enabling static site generation (SSG/SSR) and zoneless, to keep your blog lightweight and fast.
2. Follow the steps here to install [ngx-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-markdown).
3. Edit app.html to be your template used for all your pages and blogs
4. Create page.component
5. Create blog.component
