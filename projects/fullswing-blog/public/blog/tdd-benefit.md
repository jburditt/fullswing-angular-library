The biggest reason I love TDD as a developer, is that is effectively forces you to decouple your code. Otherwise it is really hard to test a single unit of code. If you are writing complicated mocks, stubs, and fakes; you probably need to decouple your code further. In the near future, I predict that TDD will not slow development when using AI from written requirements to start your tests.

For all the other reasons, you can read up on the standard [advantages/disadvantages of TDD](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-test-driven-development-tdd/) written by someone smarter and more articulate than myself.

Let's show an example:
