Chances are your company is spending more money on development than it needs to be. I would estimate 2-3 times as much. During my 20+ years of software development, I only worked for one company that was developing code efficiently; the rest were burning 2-3 times as much development effort on issues like trudging through technical debt with "quick" fixes. 

What did that one efficient company do differently? All of their project managers and management had to have software development experience. While I don't believe this is necessary, the reason I believe it worked is because management trusted the developers. Things like "technical debt" and bugs didn't get buried in the backlog, management knew that the cost would be much higher if left in the backlog and understood the weight of the developer issues. They trusted the subject experts. And this should be extended to all of your staff e.g. BA, QA, PM, management, etc. These are your subject experts and they know their domain best, trust them and the issues they bring up. Action on issues that are brought up in [sprint retrospectives](/blog/sprint-retro). 

Because I like terrible analogies, imagine micromanaging a contractor building your house and telling him "I need you to hammer in nails with a screwdriver". Your reasoning might be what you know about that domain, you know that a screwdriver is lighter and that the contractor can swing it faster. But you shouldn't be micromanaging, much like project managers shouldn't be using Agile in such a rigid fashion that developers don't have time for things like writing tests, tackling technical debt, and fixing edge-case bugs.

So how can you fix this problem? What does the problem look like? And just how inefficient is it?
